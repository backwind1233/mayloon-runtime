/**
 * Class to notify the user of events that happen.  This is how you tell
 * the user that something has happened in the background. {@more}
 *
 * Notifications can take different forms:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>A persistent icon that goes in the status bar and is accessible
 *          through the launcher, (when the user selects it, a designated Intent
 *          can be launched),</li>
 *      <li>Turning on or flashing LEDs on the device, or</li>
 *      <li>Alerting the user by flashing the backlight, playing a sound,
 *          or vibrating.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each of the notify methods takes an int id parameter and optionally a
 * {@link String} tag parameter, which may be {@code null}.  These parameters
 * are used to form a pair (tag, id), or ({@code null}, id) if tag is
 * unspecified.  This pair identifies this notification from your app to the
 * system, so that pair should be unique within your app.  If you call one
 * of the notify methods with a (tag, id) pair that is currently active and
 * a new set of notification parameters, it will be updated.  For example,
 * if you pass a new status bar icon, the old icon in the status bar will
 * be replaced with the new one.  This is also the same tag and id you pass
 * to the {@link #cancel(int)} or {@link #cancel(String, int)} method to clear
 * this notification.
 *
 * <p>
 * You do not instantiate this class directly; instead, retrieve it through
 * {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService}.
 *
 * @see android.app.Notification
 * @see android.content.Context#getSystemService
